#### How it works
This mod offers two ways to manage your waypoints: a text-based interface using chat commands and a graphical user interface (GUI). Choose the method that you find most convenient.


TEXT INTERFACE:

- Just use the following commands

**Text Commands:**

- **Create Waypoint:** `/wc <waypoint name>`
- **Delete Waypoint:** `/wd <waypoint name>`
- **Teleport to Waypoint:** `/wt <waypoint name>`
- **List Waypoints:** `/wl`

GUI:
- **Use menu:** `/wf`

NOTE:
The GUI allows you to select a beacon color from 8 available options.  When creating waypoints using the chat commands, a random color will be selected for the beacon. 

Works with Minetest 5.2.0+
